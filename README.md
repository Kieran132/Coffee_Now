## Project Goals

Coffee Now is my fourth project as part of the Code Institute Full Stack Web Developer Course.

The idea behind this project was to combine basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) with a functioning website that allows different levels of authorised user to be able to do certain tasks within the project. The technolgies used within this project are; HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python and Django. Within this project I wanted to create a modern, sleek designed, interactive platform that allows any user to view the products and be able to find contact information. In addition, allow authenticated users to add items to their wishlist. Going further, allowing admin the ability to create, read, update and delete products without the use of the admin panel.


## UXD - User Experience Design

When designing and creating this project it was important to keep the user experience at the forefront of everything. This was achieved by breaking the project down into 5 planes;

- The Strategy Plane
- The Scope Plane 
- The Structure Plane
- The Skeleton Plane
- The Surface Plane
